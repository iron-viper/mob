Write a MYSQL Select statement that displays the ​ name, dinosaur_id ​ and ​ Total number of
visitors​ for dinosaurs with more than the average number of visitors per dinosaur. The
average number of visitors can be calculated by dividing the total number of visitors by the
total number of dinosaurs. Eg. (10 + 8 + 6 + 3 +1) / 5, however the number of visitors and
number of dinosaurs will change so will need to be written programmatically. Order by total
number of visitors from most to least, do not group by name.

=========================================================================================

SELECT
	d.name,
	d.dinosaur_Id,
	v.total as 'Total number of visitors'
FROM
	dinosaurs as d
INNER JOIN visitors as v ON
	d.dinosaur_Id = v.dinosaur_id
where
	v.total > (
		SELECT
			SUM( v1.total )/ COUNT( d1.dinosaur_Id )
		FROM
			dinosaurs as d1
		INNER JOIN visitors as v1 ON
			d1.dinosaur_Id = v1.dinosaur_id
	)
ORDER BY
	v.total DESC
